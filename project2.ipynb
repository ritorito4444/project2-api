      "LeBron Raymone James Sr. (/ləˈbrɒn/[1] lə-BRON; born December 30, 1984) is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed \"King James\", he is the NBA's all-time leading scorer and has won four NBA championships from 10 NBA Finals appearances, having made eight consecutive appearances between 2011 and 2018.[2] He also won the inaugural NBA Cup in 2023 with the Lakers and has won three Olympic gold medals as a member of the U.S. national team.\n",
      "In addition to ranking fourth in NBA career assists and sixth in NBA career steals, James holds several individual honors, including four NBA MVP awards, four Finals MVP awards, the Rookie of the Year award, three All-Star Game MVP awards, the inaugural NBA Cup MVP, and the Olympics MVP in the 2024 Summer Olympics. A record 21-time All-Star and 20-time All-NBA selection (including a record 13 First Team selections), he has also made six All-Defensive Teams.[3][4] The oldest active player in the NBA, he is tied with Vince Carter for the most seasons played and holds the record for the most minutes played in league history.\n",
      "Born and raised in Akron, Ohio, James gained national attention at St. Vincent–St. Mary High School and was heavily touted as a future NBA superstar for his all-around scoring, passing, athleticism and playmaking abilities.[5] A prep-to-pro, James was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. He won Rookie of the Year and quickly established himself as one of the league's premier players, leading Cleveland to its first NBA Finals appearance in 2007 and winning the scoring title in 2008. After winning back-to-back MVPs in 2009 and 2010, he left the Cavaliers and joined the Miami Heat as a free agent in 2010, a controversial move announced in the nationally televised special titled The Decision.[6]\n",
      "With the Heat, James won his first two NBA championships in 2012 and 2013, earning MVP and Finals MVP honors both years. After four seasons in Miami, he returned to Cleveland in 2014, leading the Cavaliers to their first-ever championship in 2016 by overcoming a 3–1 deficit against the Golden State Warriors and ending the Cleveland sports curse. He signed with the Lakers in 2018, winning another title in 2020 and becoming the first player to win Finals MVP with three different teams. In 2023, he surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the NBA's all-time leading scorer, and in 2024, he and his son Bronny became the first father-son teammates in league history.  In 2025, James was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a member of the 2008 U.S. Olympic team (also known as the \"Redeem Team\").[7]\n",
      "Off the court, James has earned further wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. He is the first player in NBA history to accumulate $1 billion in earnings as an active player.[8] James has been featured in books, documentaries (including winning three Sports Emmy Awards as an executive producer), and television commercials. He was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2005, 2013, 2017, and 2019 — the most selections for a professional athlete. James has won 20 ESPY Awards, hosted Saturday Night Live, and starred in the sports film Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021). He has been a part-owner of Liverpool F.C. since 2011 and leads the LeBron James Family Foundation, which has opened an elementary school, housing complex, retail plaza, and medical center in Akron.[9][10]\n",

      "LeBron Raymone James was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, to Gloria Marie James, who was only 16 at the time of his birth.[11]: 22  His father, Anthony McClelland, has an extensive criminal record and was not involved in his life.[12][13][14] When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work.[15] Realizing that her son would be better off in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old.[11]: 23 \n",
      "James began playing organized basketball in the fifth grade.[16] He later played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars.[15] The team enjoyed success on a local and national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee.[11]: 24  The group dubbed themselves the \"Fab Four\" and promised each other that they would attend high school together.[11]: 27  In a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend St. Vincent–St. Mary High School, a private Catholic school with predominantly white students.[17]\n",

      "In 2001, during the summer before his junior year, James was the subject of a feature article in Slam magazine in which writer Ryan Jones lauded the 16-year-old James, who had grown to 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m), as \"[possibly] the best high school basketball player in America right now\".[22] During the season, James also appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, becoming the first high school basketball underclassman to do so.[11]: 104  With averages of 28 points, 8.9 rebounds, 6 assists, and 3 steals per game, he was again named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team,[18] and became the first junior to be named male basketball Gatorade National Player of the Year.[11]: 117  St. Vincent–St. Mary finished the year with a 23–4 record, ending their season with a loss in the Division II championship game.[11]: 114  Following the loss, James unsuccessfully petitioned for a change to the NBA's draft eligibility rules in an attempt to enter the 2002 NBA draft.[23][24] During this time, he used marijuana, which he said was to help cope with the stress that resulted from the constant media attention he was receiving.[25]\n",
      "Throughout his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled across the country to play several nationally ranked teams, including a game on December 12, 2002, against Oak Hill Academy that was nationally televised on ESPN2.[11]: 142  Time Warner Cable, looking to capitalize on James's popularity, offered St. Vincent–St. Mary's games to Ohio-based subscribers for $7.95 per game on a pay-per-view basis throughout the season, but ended up not being profitable.[11]: 143 [26] For the year, James averaged 30.4 points, 9.7 rebounds, 4.9 assists, and 2.9 steals per game,[18] was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive year,[11]: 178  and was named Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year.[18] He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star games—the EA Sports Roundball Classic, the Jordan Brand Capital Classic, and the McDonald's All-American Game—losing his National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) eligibility and making it official that he would enter the 2003 NBA draft.[27]\n",
      "Also during his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, James skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 as a gift from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing James's future earning power as an NBA player.[28] This prompted an investigation by the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of any wrongdoing because he had accepted the luxury vehicle from a family member and not from an agent or any outside source.[27] Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in his being stripped of his high school sports eligibility.[27] James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season.[29] In his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points.[30] St. Vincent–St. Mary went on to win the Division II championship, marking their third division title in four years.[31]\n",

      "As an underclassman, James played wide receiver for St. Vincent–St. Mary's football team.[11]: 51  He was recruited by some Division I programs, including Notre Dame.[32] At the end of his second year, James was named first team all-state, and as a junior, he helped lead the Fighting Irish to the state semifinals.[20] James did not play during his senior year because of a wrist injury that he sustained in an AAU basketball game.[33] Some sports analysts, football critics, high school coaches, as well as former and current professional players have speculated that James could have played in the National Football League (NFL).[a]\n",

He's the exception to almost every rule.\"[45] On March 20, James scored 56 points against the Toronto Raptors, setting Cleveland's new single-game points record.[46] With final averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, he was named to his first All-NBA Team.[20] Despite a 30–20 record to start the year,[46] the Cavaliers again failed to make the playoffs, finishing the season 42–40.[47]\n",

The Cavaliers then faced the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals. In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals, he logged 48 points with nine rebounds and seven assists. His performance is considered one of the greatest playoff performances of all time as he scored 29 of Cleveland's last 30 points, including 25 straight, and the game-winning layup with two seconds left. The Cavaliers won 109–107 double-overtime victory over the Detroit Pistons.[57] After the game, play-by-play announcer Marv Albert called the performance \"one of the greatest moments in postseason history\" and color commentator Steve Kerr described it as \"[Michael] Jordan-esque\".[58] In 2012, ESPN ranked the performance the fourth greatest in modern NBA playoff history.[59] The Cavaliers went on to win Game 6 and claim their first-ever Eastern Conference championship, earning them a matchup with the San Antonio Spurs in the Finals.[60] The Spurs at the time were coached by Gregg Popovich and featured a prime Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginóbili, and Bruce Bowen. With no other significant scoring threats, the Spurs built its defense around stopping James from getting into the paint. As James did not have a reliable jump shot yet nor another offensive weapon on his team, he struggled against the Spurs' zone defense.[61] He averaged 22 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on just 35.6 percent shooting,[62] as Cleveland was eliminated in a four-game sweep.[63]\n",

An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities.[91] The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade also announced that they would sign with Miami;[92] reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies.[93] James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part so that he could shoulder less of the offensive load; James thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland.[94] Heat president Pat Riley played a major role in selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade.[95] James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he thought he could be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.[94]\n",
      "Upon leaving the Cavaliers, James drew intense criticism from sports analysts, executives, fans, and current and former players. The Decision itself was also scrutinized and viewed as unnecessary. Many thought that the prolonged wait for James's choice was unprofessional as not even the teams courting him were aware of his decision until moments before the show.[96] Upon learning that James would not be returning to Cleveland, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert published an open letter to fans in which he aggressively denounced James's actions.[97] Some angry fans of the team recorded videos of themselves burning his jersey.[98] Former NBA players, including Jordan and Magic Johnson, were also critical of James, condemning him for forming a superteam with Bosh and Wade in Miami and not trying to win a championship in Cleveland, though Jordan did acknowledge that the options players had at the time were much more expansive than those he and others had in the 1980s and 1990s.[99][100][101] Some commentators did defend James's decision to join the Miami Heat by noting the Cavaliers' inability to build a strong supporting cast around him. They argued that other NBA greats had benefitted from talented teammates: Johnson had Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy, Larry Bird had Kevin McHale and Robert Parish on the Celtics, and Jordan had Scottie Pippen with the Bulls.[102] James drew further criticism in a September interview with CNN when he claimed that race might have been a factor in the fallout from The Decision.[103][104] As a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency period, James quickly gained a reputation as one of America's most disliked athletes, which marked a radical change from prior years.[105][106] The phrase \"taking my talents to South Beach\" became a punch line for critics.[107][108] In retrospect, James has expressed some regret over his handling of The Decision.[106][109][110]\n",

      "To begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3–1, including two blowout losses.[185] James responded by registering back-to-back 41-point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination.[186] In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including a chasedown block on Andre Iguodala's go-ahead layup attempt,[187] as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the city's first professional sports title in 52 years and becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3–1 series deficit in the Finals.[188] James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7,[189] and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game,[185] he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection.[190]\n",

      "Before naming James to the 2008 Olympic team, Team USA managing director Jerry Colangelo and coach Mike Krzyzewski gave James an ultimatum to improve his attitude, and he heeded their advice.[408][410] At the FIBA Americas Championship 2007, he averaged 18.1 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 4.7 assists per game, including a 31-point performance against Argentina in the championship game, the most ever by an American in an Olympic qualifier.[411] Team USA went 10–0, winning the gold medal and qualifying for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China.[403] James credited the team's attitude and experience for their improvement, saying: \"I don't think we understood what it meant to put on a USA uniform and all the people that we were representing in 2004. We definitely know that now.\"[412] At the Olympics, Team USA went unbeaten, winning their first gold medal since 2000.[413] In the final game, James's statistics were – 14 points, six rebounds, and three assists against Spain.[414]\n",

He recorded his second Olympic triple double in a comeback win in the semi-final against Serbia with 16 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists.[425] James became the first player in Olympic history with two triple doubles.[426] Team USA went on to win their fifth straight gold medal, defeating France 98–87 in the final game,[427] with James recording 14 points, 6 rebounds and 10 assists.

      "As an 18-year-old rookie, James led the Cavaliers in scoring.[437] He holds numerous \"youngest to\" distinctions,[438][439] including being the youngest player to score 30,000 career points.[440] During his first stint in Cleveland, James was primarily used as an on-ball point forward, and although his shooting tendencies were perimeter-oriented,[130] he established himself as one of the best slashers and finishers in basketball.[441][442] His combination of speed, quickness, and size often created matchup problems for opposing teams because James was capable of blowing by larger defenders and overpowering smaller ones.[443] These qualities became more apparent in transition, where he developed a reputation for grabbing defensive rebounds and then beating the defense downcourt for highlight reel baskets.[444] Around this time, James was frequently criticized for not having a reliable jump shot or post game.[445] Teams would try to exploit these weaknesses by giving him space in the half court and forcing him to settle for three-pointers and long two-pointers, a strategy famously used by Spurs coach Gregg Popovich in the 2007 Finals, where James converted on only 36 percent of his field goals in four games.[446]\n",
      "In Miami, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra changed James's role to a more unconventional one.[130] James spent more time in the post and improved his shot selection and accuracy on jump shots.[130][447] He also learned how to work as an off-ball cutter in the Heat's \"pass-happy\" offense.[448] Behind these improvements, James's overall scoring efficiency rose to historically great levels.[449] During this time, ESPN's Tom Haberstroh called James's free-throw shooting his biggest weakness, describing it as \"average\".[450] Upon returning to the Cavaliers, James began to experience subtle age-related declines in productivity,[451] posting his lowest scoring averages since his rookie season in 2015 and 2016.[3][452] His shooting also temporarily regressed, and James briefly ranked as the NBA's worst high-volume shooter from outside the paint.[453] Despite these changes, he remained an elite offensive player who beat defenses with body control, strength, and varying attacking speeds.[443]\n",
      "For most of his career, James has controlled the offense as the primary ball handler on his team.[454] His playmaking ability is generally considered one of his premier skills, and some analysts rank him among the greatest passers in NBA history.[455] By exploiting his size, vision, and the attention James garners from opposing defenses,[456] he creates easy points for his teammates with accurate assists.[457] James executes unconventional passes, including after leaving his feet and through defensive traffic.[458] His uncanny tendency to find the open man has helped force NBA teams to incorporate some elements of zone into their schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent James from passing to open shooters.[443] Early in his career, James was criticized for overpassing in pressure situations, in particular for passing instead of shooting in the waning seconds of close games;[459][460] however, as his career progressed, James's clutch performance was viewed more favorably.[461]\n",

      "At the beginning of his NBA career, James was considered a poor defensive player,[462] but he improved steadily through the years. In 2009, James became proficient at the chase-down block, which involves coming in from behind the opposition in transition to block the shot.[71] In Miami, he developed into a more versatile defensive player, and the Heat relied on him to guard all five positions.[463] From the years 2012–2016, he was ranked among the top three defenders in the NBA by general managers, earning the vote as the best perimeter defender in the league preceding the 2014–15 NBA season.[464] Along with Shane Battier and Dwyane Wade, Miami used James in an ultra-aggressive defensive scheme,[465] with James cheating off the ball to help out inside or get into rebounding position.[466] Beginning in 2014, some analysts reported a regression in his defensive impact, stemming from a lack of effort and expected age-related declines.[467][468] During his second stint in Cleveland, James's defense progressively declined. After missed drives on offense, he often dawdled back on defense while complaining to the referees; he provided less help off the ball, and was less aggressive in switching.[469] James himself admitted to taking plays off at times, referring to this approach as \"chill mode\".[470] He eventually developed a reputation for raising his defensive level in the playoffs, which some analysts referred to as \"Playoff LeBron\".[471]\n",

      "On the basis of his career longevity and on-court performances, sports publications have consistently included James in rankings of the best basketball players in history,[f] and he was named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Decade for the 2010s.[492] This has resulted in frequent comparisons to Jordan in debates over the sport's all-time best.[g] In a 2016 interview with Sports Illustrated, James acknowledged that his motivation was surpassing Jordan as the greatest.[493] In February 2018, The Ringer spent an entire week devoted to both players, with Bill Simmons ultimately concluding that Jordan was still ahead.[494] In polls, James has ranked second behind Jordan.[495][496][497] The results strongly correlate with age, with older voters more commonly choosing Jordan.[496][497] Davis et al. of Business Insider stated: \"The data would suggest that younger, more-engaged NBA fans lean toward James, as he's still playing. Older generations who watched Jordan play and tune in less today lean toward Jordan.\"[497] Referring to James as the best challenger to Jordan's status as the greatest basketball player of all time, Sam Quinn of CBS Sports stated that \"the margin for error where Jordan is involved is overwhelmingly slim\" and that \"in the rings-obsessed basketball discourse\", Jordan having more titles and an \"unblemished Finals record holds significant weight\".[493]\n",
      "In addition to praising James's on-court accomplishments, analysts have also noted his influence on player empowerment throughout the NBA, which stemmed from his willingness to change teams during free agency. Ben Golliver of The Washington Post opined that James's move to the Heat in 2010 \"defined a decade of player movement\", and that he \"fundamentally flipped the power balance between stars and their organizations.\"[498] James's fellow players have also remarked on his influence, such as Warriors forward Draymond Green, who reflected: \"We've taken control of our destiny. And I think a lot of people hate that ... I think the doors that he's opened for athletes and especially basketball players is his biggest accomplishment.\"[499] Multiple current and former NBA players have suggested James's free agency decisions catalyzed the league-wide trend in \"superteams\" in the 21st century.[500][501][502][503][504]\n",

      "James has maintained close ties to his hometown of Akron, Ohio, which is also where his charity foundation, the LeBron James Family Foundation (LJFF), is based.[548] Since 2005, the foundation has held an annual bike-a-thon to raise money for various causes.[549] In 2015, James announced a partnership with the University of Akron to provide scholarships for as many as 2,300 children beginning in 2021.[550] In 2017, he received the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award from the NBA for his \"outstanding service and dedication to the community.\"[551]\n",
      "In November 2017, the Akron School Board approved the I Promise School, a public elementary school created in a partnership with the LJFF to help struggling elementary school students stay in school.[552] The school officially opened on July 30, 2018, with James reflecting that it was his most important professional accomplishment.[553] Other noteworthy public and charitable initiatives undertaken by James in Akron include the I Promise Institute at the University of Akron,[554] I Promise Village (housing complex),[555] House Three-Thirty (community center/retail plaza),[556] and I Promise Health Quarters (medical center).[10]\n",
      "James is also an active supporter of various non-profit organizations, including After-School All-Stars, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and Children's Defense Fund.[557][558][559] In 2016, he donated $2.5 million to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture to support an exhibit on Muhammad Ali.[560]\n",

      "Politics\n",
      "James meets with presidents George W. Bush in 2008, and Barack Obama in 2012, respectively.\n",
      "Throughout his career, James has taken public stances on controversial issues, and has mentioned a feeling of obligation to effect change using his status.[561] Those include the War in Darfur,[562] the killing of Trayvon Martin,[563] the now-former NBA owner Donald Sterling's racist comments in 2014,[561] the Michael Brown verdict,[564] the death of Eric Garner,[565] the U.S. national anthem kneeling protests,[566] the shooting of Breonna Taylor,[567] the death of Ma'Khia Bryant,[568] Kyle Rittenhouse,[569] and the ruling of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.[570]\n",
      "On August 27, 2020, James and his Lakers teammates, as well as the Bucks, began boycotting the 2020 NBA playoffs to protest the shooting of Jacob Blake.[571] In response, senior White House advisor Jared Kushner stated that he was planning to reach out to James regarding the boycott. Following a players' committee to discuss the boycott, James and others reached out to former president Barack Obama, who reportedly advised them to continue playing and finish that year's NBA season.[572]\n",
      "During the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, a statement James made about a since-deleted tweet by Daryl Morey,[573] in which Morey expressed support for the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, became the subject of controversy. James said Morey was \"misinformed\".[574] His statement drew backlash from protesters in the movement, with many taking to social media to use racist language against him.[575][576][577] In February 2022, political commentator Bill Maher called James hypocritical for not taking a critical stance towards the Chinese government's human rights abuses.[578] James had taken various other stands on issues regarding sports, such as the Kaepernick controversy and the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal.[579][580]\n",
      "In October 2023, in response to the Gaza war, James voiced his support for Israel on Instagram.[581] His statement drew backlash for its omission of the Palestinians affected by the crisis, including from Palestinian-American leader and activist Omar Suleiman.[582][583][584]\n",

      "Presidential elections\n",
      "In June 2008, James donated $20,000 to a committee in support of Barack Obama for the 2008 U.S. presidential election.[585] Later that year, James gathered almost 20,000 people at the then-called Quicken Loans Arena for a viewing of Obama's 30-minute American Stories, American Solutions television advertisement.[586] The advertisement was shown on a large screen above the stage, where Jay-Z later held a free concert.[586] In November 2016, James endorsed and campaigned for Hillary Clinton for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[587]\n",

      "James with California governor Gavin Newsom on The Shop, when Newsom signed the Fair Pay to Play Act, in 2019.\n",
      "Following a racist incident at his Los Angeles home in 2017, James expressed that \"being black in America is tough. We got a long way to go for us as a society and for us as African Americans until we feel equal in America.\"[588] Later on that year, in the aftermath of the Unite the Right rally, James questioned the \"Make America Great Again\" slogan and said: \"It's sad what's going on in Charlottesville. Is this the direction our country is heading? Make America Great Again huh? Our youth deserve better!!\"[589] James also called President Donald Trump a \"bum\" after the president rescinded a White House invitation to Stephen Curry.[590] During a 2018 interview with CNN journalist Don Lemon, James then accused Trump of attempting to divide the country with sports, suggesting that \"sports has never been something that divides people it's always been something that brings someone together.\" He declared that he would \"never sit across from him. I'd sit across from Obama though.\"[591][592] In response, Trump tweeted: \"LeBron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made LeBron look smart, which isn't easy to do.\"[593]\n",
      "On August 19, 2020, James announced his intentions to support the Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign and that of his running-mate Kamala Harris in advance of the 2020 U.S. presidential election.[594] James spoke in support of the More Than a Vote movement and encouraged members of the African-American community to vote,[595] saying, \"People in our community have been just lied to for so many years. We have people that have had convictions in the past, that've been told they cannot vote because they got a conviction. That is voter suppression.\"[596]\n",
      "On October 31, 2024, James announced his support for the Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign in the 2024 U.S. presidential election in a video posted on social media.[597]\n",

      "Endorsements\n",
      "James has signed numerous endorsement contracts; some of the companies that he has done business with are AT&T,[600] Audemars Piguet,[601] Beats by Dre,[602] Blaze Pizza,[603] Coca-Cola,[604] Dunkin' Brands,[605] Intel,[606] Kia,[607] McDonald's,[608] Nike,[604] PepsiCo,[609] State Farm,[610] and Taco Bell.[611] Coming out of high school, James was the target of a three-way bidding war among Nike, Reebok, and Adidas,[612] eventually signing a seven-year deal with Nike in May 2003[613][614] for approximately $90 million.[615] His signature shoes have performed well for Nike.[616] In 2011, Fenway Sports Group became the sole global marketer of his rights, and as part of the deal, James was granted a minority stake in the English Premier League football club Liverpool,[617] who he has claimed his support for.[618] As a result of his endorsement money and NBA salary, James has been listed as one of the world's highest-paid athletes.[619] In 2013, he surpassed Bryant as the highest paid basketball player in the world, with earnings of $56.5 million.[620] In 2014, James realized a profit of more than $30 million as part of Apple's acquisition of Beats Electronics; he had originally struck a deal to get a small stake in the company at its inception in exchange for promoting its headphones.[621] In 2015, James was ranked the sixth highest earning sportsperson,[622] and third highest in 2016 (after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi).[623] James has stated that he would like to own an NBA team in the future, albeit in a hands-off capacity.[624] In 2011, James co-founded the designer retail store UNKNWN in Miami, Florida.[625]\n",
      "During Super Bowl LVI in 2022, James appeared in a Crypto.com advertisement, where he conversed with a CGI version of his younger self, offering advice about the future. The commercial, produced by James's SpringHill Company and directed by Calmatic, did not directly promote the service, sparked social media buzz, and inspired a series of memes centered on the advice he could have offered.[626]\n",
      "Subsequently, Crypto.com launched an NFT airdrop campaign, distributing 5,550 tokens featuring the NBA champion. Participants were chosen randomly from those who scanned a QR code in the Super Bowl ad.[627] Also, in 2022, James's charity LeBron James Family Foundation, partnered with Crypto.com to educate underserved Akron communities with blockchain-related knowledge and Web3 tools, aiming to ensure inclusive advancement in the digital age.[628][629]\n",

      "Entertainment\n",
      "James and comedian Jimmy Kimmel co-hosted the 2007 ESPY Awards.[630] In other comedic pursuits, he hosted the 33rd-season premiere of Saturday Night Live.[631] James has also tried his hand at acting, appearing in a cameo role on the HBO series Entourage.[632] In 2015, he played himself in the Judd Apatow film Trainwreck,[633] receiving positive reviews for his performance.[634] That same year, James's digital video company Uninterrupted raised $15.8 million from Warner Bros. Entertainment and Turner Sports to help expand the company's efforts to bring athlete-created content to fans. It is hosted on Bleacher Report and is used by several other athletes including Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end Rob Gronkowski and cornerback Richard Sherman.[635]\n",
      "James and his business partner Maverick Carter own production company SpringHill Entertainment,[636] whose first work was the Lions Gate documentary More Than a Game, which was released in 2009 and chronicled James's high school years.[637] Series produced by SpringHill include the NBC game show The Wall,[638] the Disney XD sports documentary show Becoming,[639] the Starz sitcom Survivor's Remorse,[640] and the animated web series The LeBrons.[641] In 2016, CNBC aired an unscripted series hosted by James called Cleveland Hustles, where four up-and-coming Northern Ohio entrepreneurs will be financed on the condition of revitalizing a neighborhood in Cleveland.[642] In the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, a 60-minute Vince Carter documentary entitled The Carter Effect was executive produced by James and Maverick Carter along with rapper Drake and Future the Prince.[643][644] In February 2018, it was announced that James's production company will produce a new film in the House Party series with James expected to make a cameo.[645] Later that month, Fox News host Laura Ingraham told James to \"shut up and dribble\" as a response to his political agendas.[646] This largely contributed to James creating a documentary film series looking at the changing role of athletes in the current political and cultural climate, aptly named, Shut Up and Dribble on Showtime.[647] James partnered with Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2018 to found Ladder, a company that developed nutritional supplements to help athletes with severe cramps after dealing with that issue during the 2014 Finals.[648]\n",
      "In February 2019, it was revealed that James would executive produce rapper 2 Chainz's new album Rap or Go to the League.[649] A Def Jam press release said the intent of the album is \"celebrating black excellence and focusing on the power of education and entrepreneurship.\" The press release also says the title \"challenges the notion that the only way out of the inner city is either to become a rapper or a ball player.\"[650] As of June 2023, James is the most followed basketball player on Instagram, with over 155 million followers.[651]\n",
      "In June 2022, it was announced James was launching a media company in partnership with professional tennis player Naomi Osaka and Maverick Carter. The production and content creation company will be named Hana Kuma, which means \"flower\" and \"bear\" in Japanese.[652]\n",
      "In March 2024, James and JJ Redick launched a podcast called Mind the Game, where the two have \"pure conversations about basketball.\"[653][654][655] The podcast was suspended after Redick was hired as head coach for the Los Angeles Lakers in June 2024.[656] In March 2025, a second season was announced with Steve Nash replacing Redick as James's new co-host.[657]\n",
      "\n",
      "Investments\n",
      "In 2012, James, Carter and Paul Wachter made an investment of less than $1 million in the Pasadena-based fast casual chain Blaze Pizza; their investment had grown to $25 million by 2017.[658] James later became a spokesman for the company and began appearing in advertisements after ending his contract with McDonald's.[658]\n",
      "During the 2019 offseason, James filed for a trademark through a shell company on the term \"Taco Tuesday\" for use in downloadable audio/visual works, podcasts, social media, online marketing, and entertainment services.[659] This was related to James's use of the term on Instagram for his family's taco dinners. The request was denied by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, stating that Taco Tuesday was \"a commonplace term, message or expression widely used by a variety of sources that merely conveys an ordinary, familiar, well-recognized concept or sentiment.\"[660]\n",
      "In November 2020, James became an angel investor of the tequila and mezcal company Lobos 1707.[661] After personal frustration with comments on the Black Lives Matter movement made by Republican U.S. senator Kelly Loeffler, who at the time was the owner of the WNBA's Atlanta Dream, James assisted Dream player Renee Montgomery in her ultimately successful bid to buy the team in March 2021.[662] That same year, James joined Fenway Sports Group as a partner, making him a part-owner of the Boston Red Sox, New England Sports Network, RFK Racing, and Liverpool F.C., the latter of which he already owned a two-percent share in individually.[663] The investment made James and Carter the company's first black partners.[663]\n",
      "James has expressed his interest in owning an NBA team once he finishes playing basketball, specifically a team located in Las Vegas, Nevada, either through expansion or relocation.[664]\n",
      "In August 2022, James, alongside Canadian musician Drake, became part owners of the Italian football club A.C. Milan.[665]\n",
      "James is also a part owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League (NHL).[666]\n",
      "\n",
      "Professional contracts\n",
      "James is represented by agent Rich Paul of Klutch Sports.[667] His first agent was Aaron Goodwin, whom he left in 2005 for Leon Rose. Rose joined Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in 2007, and he worked with fellow CAA agent Henry Thomas, who represented Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, to bring James to Miami in 2010. James left CAA for Paul in 2012.[668] James, Paul, Carter, and Randy Mims—all childhood friends—formed agent and sports-marketing company LRMR after James left Goodwin. LRMR handles James's marketing, including the marketing of The Decision, for which it was criticized.[669][670]\n",
      "Throughout his career, James has taken a unique approach to his NBA contracts, usually opting to sign shorter-term deals in order to maximize his earnings potential and flexibility;[112][671][672] in 2006, James and the Cavaliers negotiated a three-year, $60 million contract extension instead of the four-year maximum as it allotted him the option of seeking a new contract worth more money as an unrestricted free agent following the 2010 season.[673] This move ultimately allowed James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh to sign together with the Heat.[674] During the 2011 NBA lockout, James received contract offers to play professional football from the Dallas Cowboys and Seattle Seahawks,[675] which he gave serious consideration to and even began training with it in mind.[676] During his second stint in Cleveland, based on a negotiation strategy devised by NBA agent Mark Termini, who worked with Paul and specialized in contract negotiation and construction,[677] James began re-signing[678][679] on new contracts after each season in order to take advantage of higher salaries resulting from the NBA's rising salary cap.[171] In 2016, he signed with the Cavaliers on a three-year deal,[680] becoming the highest-paid player in the league for the first time in his career.[681]\n",
